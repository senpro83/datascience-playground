# Environment Setup Complete! 🎉

Your Data Science Playground is ready to use. Here's how to get started:

## ✅ What Was Installed

- **Python 3.13.7** virtual environment
- **ipykernel 7.1.0** - for running Jupyter notebooks
- **All data science libraries** from requirements.txt
- **Jupyter kernel registered** as "Python 3 (datascience-playground)"

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start Jupyter Notebook

1. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   cd datascience-playground
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   
   OR use JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. **Open the getting_started notebook:**
   - Navigate to `notebooks/getting_started.ipynb`
   - Select the kernel: **"Python 3 (datascience-playground)"**
   - Run the cells!

### Select the Correct Kernel

When opening any notebook, make sure to select the correct kernel:
- Click on the kernel name in the top right
- Choose: **"Python 3 (datascience-playground)"**

Or set it via: `Kernel` → `Change Kernel` → `Python 3 (datascience-playground)`

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Or start JupyterLab
jupyter lab

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

## 📝 What's Available

All these libraries are installed and ready to use:
- NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter, JupyterLab, ipykernel
- And many more!

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Run the `getting_started.ipynb` notebook to see examples
2. Create new notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder
3. Add your data files to the `data/` folder
4. Save your visualizations in the `plots/` folder
5. Import utilities from `src.utils` in your notebooks

**Happy Data Exploring! 🚀**
